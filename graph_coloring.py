Given an undirected graph with maximum degree D, find a graph coloring using
at most D+1 colors.

For example:

.
This graph's maximum degree (D) is 3, so we have 4 colors (D+1). Here's one
possible coloring:

.
Graphs are represented by a list of node objects, each with a label, a set of
neighbors, and a color:

  class GraphNode:

    def __init__(self, label):
        self.label = label
        self.neighbors = set()
        self.color = None

a = GraphNode('a')
b = GraphNode('b')
c = GraphNode('c')

a.neighbors.add(b)
b.neighbors.add(a)
b.neighbors.add(c)
c.neighbors.add(b)

graph = [a, b, c]

Breakdown
Let's take a step back. Is it always possible to find a legal coloring with D+1
colors?

Let's think about it. Each node has at most D neighbors, and we have D+1
colors. So, if we look at any node, there's always at least one color that's
not taken by its neighbors.

So yes D+1 is always enough colors for a legal coloring.

Still not convinced? We can prove this more formally using induction.

Okay, so there is always a legal coloring. Now, how can we find it?

A brute force approach would be to try every possible combination of colors
until we find a legal coloring. Our steps would be:

For each possible graph coloring,
If the coloring is legal, then return it
Otherwise, move on to the next coloring
For example, looking back at our sample graph:

.
D is 3, so we can use 4 colors. The combinations of 4 colors for all 12 nodes
are:

red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red
red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, yellow
red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, green
red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, blue
red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, yellow, red
...
blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, green
blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue

And we'd keep trying combinations until we reach one that legally colors the
graph.

This would work. But what's the complexity?

Here we'd try 4^{12}
combinations (every combination of 4 colors for 12 nodes). In general, we'll
have to check O(D^n) colorings. And that's not all, each time we try a coloring,
we have to check all M edges to see if the vertices at both ends have
different colors. So, our runtime is O(M*D^n). That's exponential time since n
is in an exponent.

Since this algorithm is so inefficient, it's probably not what the interviewer
is looking for. With practice, it gets easier to quickly judge if an approach
will be inefficient. Still, sometimes it's a good idea in an interview to
briefly explain inefficient ideas and why you think they're inefficient. It
shows rigorous thinking.

How can we color the graph more efficiently?

Well, we're wasting a lot of time trying color combinations that don't work. If
the first 2 nodes are neighbors, we shouldn't try any combinations where the
first 2 colors are the same.

Instead of assigning all the colors at once, what if we colored the nodes one
by one?

We could assign a color to the first node, then find a legal color for the
second node, then for the third node, and keep going node by node.

  def color_graph(graph, colors):

    for node in graph:

        # get the node's neighbors' colors, as a set so we
        # can check if a color is illegal in constant time
        illegal_colors = set([neighbor.color for neighbor in node.neighbors if neighbor.color])
        legal_colors = [color for color in colors if color not in illegal_colors]

        # assign the first legal color
        node.color = legal_colors[0]

Is it possible we'll back ourselves into a corner somehow and run out of colors
for some nodes?

Let's think back to our earlier argument about whether a coloring always exists:
Each node has at most D neighbors, and we have D+1 colors. So, if we look
at any node, there's always at least one color that's not taken by its neighbors.

That reasoning works here, too! So no, we'll never back ourselves into a corner.

Ok, what's our runtime?

We're iterating through each node in the graph, so the loop body executes N
times. In each iteration of the loop:

We look at the current node's neighbors to figure out what colors are already
taken. That's O(D), since any given node can have up to D neighbors.

Then, we look at all the colors (there are O(D) of them) to see which ones
are available.

Finally, we pick the first color that's free and assign it to the node (O(1).

So our runtime is N*(D+D+1), which is O(N*D).

Can we tighten our analysis a bit here? Take a look at step 1, where we collect
the neighbors' colors:

We said looking at each node's neighbors was O(D) since each node can have at
most D neighbors . . . but each node might have way fewer neighbors than that.

Can we say anything about the total number of neighbors we'll look at across
all of the loop iterations? How many neighbors are there in the entire graph?

Each edge creates two neighbors: one for each node on either end. So when our
code looks at every neighbor for every node, it looks at 2*M neighbors in all.

With O(M) neighbors, collecting all the colors over the entire for loop takes
O(M) time.

Using this tighter analysis, we've taken our runtime from N*(D+D+1) down to
N*(D+1)+M. That's O(N*D + M)time.

Of course, that complexity doesn't look any faster, at least not
asymptotically. But in the underlying expression, we've gotten rid of one the
two N*D factors.

Can we get rid of the other one to bring our complexity down to linear time?

The remaining N*D factor comes from step 2: looking at every color for every
node to populate legal_colors.

Do we have to look at every color for every node?

When we're coloring a node, we just need one color that hasn't been taken by
any of the node's neighbors. We can stop looking at colors as soon as we find
one:

  def color_graph(graph, colors):

    for node in graph:

        # get the node's neighbors' colors, as a set so we
        # can check if a color is illegal in constant time
        illegal_colors = set([neighbor.color for neighbor in node.neighbors if neighbor.color])

        # assign the first legal color
        for color in colors:
            if color not in illegal_colors:
                node.color = color
                break

Okay, now what's the time cost of assigning the first legal color to every node
(the whole last block)?

We'll try at most len(illegal_colors) + 1 colors in total. That's how many we'd
need if we happen to test all the colors in illegal_colors first, before
finally testing the one legal color last.

Remember the "+1" we get from testing the one legal color last! It's going to
be important in a second.

How many colors are in illegal_colors? It's at most the number of neighbors, if
each neighbor has a different color.

Let's use that trick of looking at all of the loop iterations together. In
total, over the course of the entire loop, how many neighbors are there?

Well, each of our M edges add two neighbors to the graph: one for each node on
either end. So that's 2*M neighbors in total. Which means 2*M illegal colors in
total.

But remember: we said we'd try as many as len(illegal_colors) + 1 colors per
node. We still have to factor in that "+1"! Across all N of our nodes, that's
an additional N colors. So we try 2*M+N colors in total across all of our
nodes.

That's O(M+N) time for assigning the first legal color to every node. Add that
to the O(M) for finding all the illegal colors, and we get O(M+N) time in total
for our graph coloring function.

Is this the fastest runtime we can get? We'll have to look at every node (O(N))
and every edge (O(M)) at least once, so yeah, we can't get any better than
O(N+M).

How about our space cost?

The only data structure we allocate with non-constant space is the set of
illegal colors. What's the most space that ever takes up?

In the worst case, the neighbors of the node with the maximum degree will all
have different colors, so our space cost is O(D).

Before we're done, what about edge cases?

For graph problems in general, edge cases are:

nodes with no edges
cycles
loops
What if there are nodes with no edges? Will our function still color every node?

Yup, no problem. Isolated nodes tend to cause problems when we're traversing a
graph (starting from one node and "walking along" edges to other nodes, like we
do in a depth-first or breadth-first search). We're not doing that here
instead, we're iterating over a list of all the nodes.

What if the graph has a cycle?  Will our function still work?

Yes, it will. Cycles also tend to cause problems with graph traversal, because
we can end up in infinite loops (going around and around the cycle). But we're
not actually traversing our graph here.

What if the graph has a loop?

That's a problem. A node with a loop is adjacent to itself, so it can't have
the same color as . . . itself. So it's impossible to "legally color" a node
with a loop. So we should throw an error.

How can we detect loops?

We know a node has a loop if the node is in its own list of neighbors.

Solution
We go through the nodes in one pass, assigning each node the first legal color
we find.

How can we be sure we'll always have at least one legal color for every node?
In a graph with maximum degree D, each node has at most D neighbors. That
means there are at most D colors taken by a node's neighbors. And we have D+1
colors, so there's always at least one color left to use.

When we color each node, we're careful to stop iterating over colors as soon as
we find a legal color.

  def color_graph(graph, colors):

    for node in graph:

        if node in node.neighbors:
            raise Exception('Legal coloring impossible for node with loop: %s' % node.label)

        # get the node's neighbors' colors, as a set so we
        # can check if a color is illegal in constant time
        illegal_colors = set([neighbor.color for neighbor in node.neighbors if neighbor.color])

        # assign the first legal color
        for color in colors:
            if color not in illegal_colors:
                node.color = color
                break

Complexity
O(N+M) time where N is the number of nodes and M is the number of edges.

The runtime might not look linear because we have outer and inner loops. The
trick is to look at each step and think of things in terms of the total number
of edges (M) wherever we can:

We check if each node appears in its own set of neighbors. Checking if
something is in a set is O(1), so doing it for all N nodes is O(N).
When we get the illegal colors for each node, we iterate through that node's
neighbors. So in total, we cross each of the graphs M edges twice: once for
the node on either end of each edge. O(M) time.

When we assign a color to each node, we're careful to stop checking colors as
soon as we find one that works. In the worst case, we'll have to check one more
color than the total number of neighbors. Again, each edge in the graph adds
two neighbors one for the node on either end so there are 2*M neighbors. So, in
total, we'll have to try O(N+M) colors.

Putting all the steps together, our complexity is O(N+M).

What about space complexity? The only thing we're storing is the illegal_colors
set. In the worst case, all the neighbors of a node with the maximum degree (D)
have different colors, so our set takes up O(D) space.

Bonus
Our solution runs in O(N+M) time but takes O(D) space. Can we get down to
O(1) space?

Our solution finds a legal coloring, but there are usually many legal colorings.
What if we wanted to optimize a coloring to use as few colors as possible?

The lowest number of colors we can use to legally color a graph is called the
chromatic number.

There's no known polynomial time solution for finding a graph's chromatic
number. It might be impossible, or maybe we just haven't figured out a solution
yet.

We can't even determine in polynomial time if a graph can be colored using a
given k colors. Even if k is as low as 3.

We care about polynomial time solutions (n raised to a constant power, like
O(n^2) because for large ns, polynomial time algorithms are more practical to
actually use than higher runtimes like exponential time (a constant raised to
the power of n, like O(2^n). Computer scientists usually call algorithms with
polynomial time solutions feasible, and problems with worse runtimes
intractable.

The problem of determining if a graph can be colored with k colors is in the
class of problems called NP (nondeterministic polynomial time). This means that
in polynomial time, we can verify a solution is correct but we can't come up
with a solution. In this case, if we have a graph that's already colored with k
colors we verify the coloring uses k colors and is legal, but we can't take a
graph and a number k and determine if the graph can be colored with k colors.

If you can find a solution or prove a solution doesn't exist, you'll win a
$1,000,000 Millennium Problem Prize.

For coloring a graph using as few colors as possible, we don't have a feasible
solution and for real-world problems we'd often need to check so many
possibilities that we'll never be able to use brute-force no matter how
advanced our computers become.

One way to reliably reduce the number of colors we use is to use the greedy
algorithm but carefully order the nodes. For example, we can prioritize nodes
based on their degree, the number of colored neighbors they have, or the number
of uniquely colored neighbors they have.

What We Learned
We used a greedy approach to build up a correct solution in one pass through
the nodes.

This brought us close to the optimal runtime, but we also had to take that last
step of iterating over the colors only until we find a legal color. Sometimes
stopping a loop like that is just a premature optimization that doesn't bring
down the final runtime, but here it actually made our runtime linear!

'''
You have a linked list and want to find the kth to last node.
Write a function kth_to_last_node() that takes an integer k and the head_node of
a singly linked list, and returns the kth to last node in the list.

For example:

  class LinkedListNode:

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next  = None

a = LinkedListNode("Angel Food")
b = LinkedListNode("Bundt")
c = LinkedListNode("Cheese")
d = LinkedListNode("Devil's Food")
e = LinkedListNode("Eccles")

a.next = b
b.next = c
c.next = d
d.next = e

kth_to_last_node(2, a)
# returns the node with value "Devil's Food" (the 2nd to last node)


Breakdown
It might be tempting to iterate through the list until we reach the end and then
walk backwards k nodes.

But we have a singly linked list! We can't go backwards. What else can we do?

What if we had the length of the list?

Then we could calculate how far to walk, starting from the head, to reach the
kth to last node.

If the list has n nodes:

A linked list represented by circles and arrows, with the distance from the
first to the last node labeled n. And our target is the kth to last node:

A linked list represented by circles and arrows, with the distance from the
first to the last node labeled n. The third-to-last node is the kth to last
node, with its distance to the last node labeled k. The distance from the head
to the target is n-k:

A linked list represented by circles and arrows, with the distance from the
first to the last node labeled n. The third-to-last node is the kth to last
node, with its distance to the last node labeled k and its distance to the first
node labeled n minus k.

Well, we don't know the length of the list (n). But can we figure it out?

Yes, we could iterate from the head to the tail and count the nodes!

Can you implement this approach in code?

def kth_to_last_node(k, head):

    # STEP 1: get the length of the list
    # start at 1, not 0
    # else we'd fail to count the head node!
    list_length = 1
    current_node = head

    # traverse the whole list,
    # counting all the nodes
    while current_node.next:
        current_node = current_node.next
        list_length += 1

    # STEP 2: walk to the target node
    # calculate how far to go, from the head,
    # to get to the kth to last node
    how_far_to_go = list_length - k

    current_node = head
    for i in xrange(how_far_to_go):
        current_node = current_node.next

    return current_node

What are our time and space costs?

O(n) time and O(1) space, where n is the length of the list.

More precisely, it takes n steps to get the length of the list, and another n-k
steps to reach the target node. In the worst case k=1, so we have to walk all
the way from head to tail again to reach the target node. This is a total of 2n
steps, which is O(n).

Can we do better?

Mmmmaaaaaaybe.

The fact that we walk through our whole list once just to get the length, then
walk through the list again to get to the kth to last element sounds like a lot
of work. Perhaps we can do this in just one pass?

What if we had like a "stick" that was k nodes wide. We could start it at the
beginning of the list, so that the left side of the stick was on the head and
the right side was on the kth node.

A linked list represented by circles and arrows. The third node is labeled
"kth," and a linear "stick" k nodes long extends from above the first node to
above the kth node.

Then we could slide the stick down the list...

A linked list represented by circles and arrows. The third node is labeled
"kth," and a linear "stick" k nodes long extends from above the second node to
above the fourth node.

...until the right side hit the end. At that point, the left side of the stick
would be on the kth to last node!

A linked list represented by circles and arrows. The third-to-last node is
labeled "kth to last," and a linear "stick" k nodes long extends from above the
kth-to-last node to above the last node. How can we implement this? Maybe it'll
help to keep two pointers?

We can allocate two variables that'll be references to the nodes at the left and
right sides of the "stick"!

  def kth_to_last_node(k, head):

    left_node  = head
    right_node = head

    # move right_node to the kth node
    for _ in xrange(k - 1):
        right_node = right_node.next

    # starting with left_node on the head,
    # move left_node and right_node down the list,
    # maintaining a distance of k between them,
    # until right_node hits the end of the list
    while right_node.next:
        left_node  = left_node.next
        right_node = right_node.next

    # since left_node is k nodes behind right_node,
    # left_node is now the kth to last node!
    return left_node

This'll work, but does it actually save us any time?

Solution
We can think of this two ways.

First approach: use the length of the list.

walk down the whole list, counting nodes, to get the total list_length.
subtract k from the list_length to get the distance from the head node to the
target node (the kth to last node). walk that distance from the head to arrive
at the target node.

  def kth_to_last_node(k, head):

    if k < 1:
        raise ValueError('Impossible to find less than first to last node: %s' % k)

    # STEP 1: get the length of the list
    # start at 1, not 0
    # else we'd fail to count the head node!
    list_length = 1
    current_node = head

    # traverse the whole list,
    # counting all the nodes
    while current_node.next:
        current_node = current_node.next
        list_length += 1

    # if k is greater than the length of the list, there can't
    # be a kth-to-last node, so we'll return an error!
    if k > list_length:
        raise ValueError('k is larger than the length of the linked list: %s' % k)

    # STEP 2: walk to the target node
    # calculate how far to go, from the head,
    # to get to the kth to last node
    how_far_to_go = list_length - k

    current_node = head
    for i in xrange(how_far_to_go):
        current_node = current_node.next

    return current_node

Second approach: maintain a k-wide "stick" in one walk down the list.

Walk one pointer k nodes from the head. Call it right_node.
Put another pointer at the head. Call it left_node.
Walk both pointers, at the same speed, towards the tail. This keeps a distance
of kk between them. When right_node hits the tail, left_node is on the target
(since it's k nodes from the end of the list).

  def kth_to_last_node(k, head):

    if k < 1:
        raise ValueError('Impossible to find less than first to last node: %s' % k)

    left_node  = head
    right_node = head

    # move right_node to the kth node
    for _ in xrange(k - 1):

        # but along the way, if a right_node doesn't have a next,
        # then k is greater than the length of the list and there
        # can't be a kth-to-last node! we'll raise an error
        if not right_node.next:
            raise ValueError('k is larger than the length of the linked list: %s' % k)

        right_node = right_node.next

    # starting with left_node on the head,
    # move left_node and right_node down the list,
    # maintaining a distance of k between them,
    # until right_node hits the end of the list
    while right_node.next:
        left_node  = left_node.next
        right_node = right_node.next

    # since left_node is k nodes behind right_node,
    # left_node is now the kth to last node!
    return left_node

In either approach, make sure to check if k is greater than the length of the
linked list! That's bad input, and we'll want to raise an error.

Complexity
Both approaches use O(n) time and O(1) space.

But the second approach is fewer steps, since it gets the answer "in one pass,"
right? Wrong.

In the first approach, we walk one pointer from head to tail (to get the list's
length), then walk another pointer from the head node to the target node (the
kth to last node).

In the second approach, right_node also walks all the way from head to tail, and
left_node also walks from the head to the target node.

So in both cases we have two pointers taking the same steps through our list.
The only difference is the order in which the steps are taken. The number of
steps is the same either way.

However, the second approach might still be slightly faster, due to some caching
and other optimizations that modern processors and memory have.

Let's focus on caching. Usually when we grab some data from memory (for example,
info about a linked list node), we also store that data in a small cache right
on the processor. If we need to use that same data again soon after, we can
quickly grab it from the cache. But if we don't use that data for a while, we're
likely to replace it with other stuff we've used more recently (this is called a
"least recently used" replacement policy).

Both of our algorithms access a lot of nodes in our list twice, so they could
exploit this caching. But notice that in our second algorithm there's a much
shorter time between the first and second times that we access a given node
(this is sometimes called "temporal locality of reference"). Thus it seems more
likely that our second algorithm will save time by using the processor's cache!
But this assumes our processor's cache uses something like a "least recently
used" replacement policy it might use something else. Ultimately the best way to
really know which algorithm is faster is to implement both and time them on a
few different inputs!

Bonus
Can we do better? What if we expect n to be huge and k to be pretty small. In
this case our target node will be close to the end of the list...so it seems a
waste that we have to walk all the way from the beginning twice.

Can we trim down the number of steps in the "second trip"? One pointer will
certainly have to travel all the way from head to tail in the list to get the
total length...but can we store some "checkpoints" as we go so that the second
pointer doesn't have to start all the way at the beginning? Can we store these
"checkpoints" in constant space? Note: this approach only saves time if we know
that our target node is towards the end of the list (in other words, n is much
larger than k).

What We Learned
We listed two good solutions. One seemed to solve the problem in one pass, while
the other took two passes. But the single-pass approach didn't take half as many
steps, it just took the same steps in a different order.

So don't be fooled: "one pass" isn't always fewer steps than "two passes."
Always ask yourself, "Have I actually changed the number of steps?"

I figured out how to get rich: online poker.
I suspect the online poker game I'm playing shuffles cards by doing a single
"riffle"

To prove this, let's write a function to tell us if a full deck of cards
shuffled_deck is a single riffle of two other halves half1 and half2.

We'll represent a stack of cards as a list of integers in the range 1..52 (since
there are 52 distinct cards in a deck).

Why do I care? A single riffle is not a completely random shuffle. If I'm right,
I can make more informed bets and get rich and finally prove to my ex that I am
not a "loser with an unhealthy cake obsession" (even though it's too late now
because she let me go and she's never getting me back).



Breakdown
How can we re-phrase this problem in terms of smaller subproblems?

Breaking the problem into smaller subproblems will clearly involve reducing the
size of at least one of our stacks of cards.

So to start, let's try taking the first card out of shuffled_deck.

What should be true of this card if shuffled_deck is a riffle of half1 and
half2?

If shuffled_deck is a riffle of half1 and half2, then the first card from
shuffled_deck should be either the same as the first card from half1 or the same
as the first card from half2.

If we're looking at our decks face-up, from above (so we only see the top card),
this could be a single riffle:

Looking at three face up stacks of cards, the top card of the shuffled deck is
10, the top card of half 1 is 7, and the top card of half 2 is 10.

While this could not:

Looking at three face up stacks of cards, the top card of the shuffled deck is
32, the top card of half 1 is 7, and the top card of half 2 is 10.

Now that we know the first card checks out, how do we get to our subproblem?

Let's "throw out" the top card from shuffled_deck as well as the card it matched
with from the top of half1 or half2. Those cards are now "accounted for."

Now we're left with a smaller version of the original problem, which we can
solve using the same approach! So we keep doing this over and over until we
exhaust shuffled_deck. If we get to the end and each card "checks out," we
return True.

How do we implement this in code?

Now that we have a problem that's the same as the original problem except
smaller, our first thought might be to use recursion. All we need is a base
case. What's our base case?

We stop when we run out of cards in our shuffled_deck. So that's our base case:
when we've checked all cards in shuffled_deck, we return True because we know
all of the cards have been "accounted for."

  def is_single_riffle(half1, half2, shuffled_deck):

    # base case
    if len(shuffled_deck) == 0:
        return True

    # if the top of shuffled_deck is the same as the top of half1
    # (making sure first that we have a top card in half1)
    if len(half1) and half1[0] == shuffled_deck[0]:

        # take the top cards off half1 and shuffled_deck and recurse
        return is_single_riffle(half1[1:], half2, shuffled_deck[1:])

    # if the top of shuffled_deck is the same as the top of half2
    elif len(half2) and half2[0] == shuffled_deck[0]:

        # take the top cards off half2 and shuffled_deck and recurse
        return is_single_riffle(half1, half2[1:], shuffled_deck[1:])

    # top of shuffled_deck doesn't match top of half1 or half2
    # so we know it's not a single riffle
    else:
        return False


This solution will work. But we can do better.

Before we talk about optimization, note that our inputs are of small and
constant size. This function will take hardly any time or space, even if it
could be more efficient. In industry, especially at small startups that want to
move quickly, optimizing this might be considered a "premature optimization."
But if we're going to do something inefficient, we should at least know about
it. Great engineers have both the skill to see how to optimize their code and
the wisdom to know when those optimizations aren't worth it. At this point in
the interview I recommend saying "I think we can optimize this a bit further,
although given the constraints on the input this probably won't be very
resource-intensive anyway...should we talk about optimizations?"

Okay, back to our show. This function will take O(n^2) time and O(n^2)
additional space.

Whaaaaat? Yeah. Take a look at this snippet:

  return is_single_riffle(half1[1:], half2, shuffled_deck[1:])

In particular this expression:

  half1[1:]

That's a slice, and it costs O(m) time and space, where m is the size of the
resulting list. That's going to determine our overall time and space cost here
the rest of the work we're doing is constant space and time.

In our recursing we'll build up n frames on the call stack. Each of those frames
will hold a different slice of our original shuffled_deck (and half1 and half2,
though we only slice one of them in each recursive call).

So, what's the total time and space cost of all our slices?

If shuffled_deck has n items to start, taking our first slice takes n-1 time and
space (plus half that, since we're also slicing one of our halves, but that's
just a constant multiplier so we can ignore it). In our second recursive call,
slicing takes n-2 time and space. Etcetera.

So our total time and space cost for slicing comes to:


(n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 2 + 1

This is a common series that turns out to be O(n^2).

We can do better than this O(n^2) time and space cost.
One way we could to that is to avoid slicing and instead keep track of indices
in the list:

  def is_single_riffle(half1, half2, shuffled_deck, shuffled_deck_index=0, half1_index=0, half2_index=0):

    # base case we've hit the end of shuffled_deck
    if shuffled_deck_index == len(shuffled_deck):
        return True

    # if we still have cards in half1
    # and the "top" card in half1 is the same
    # as the top card in shuffled_deck
    if (half1_index < len(half1)) and \
            half1[half1_index] == shuffled_deck[shuffled_deck_index]:
        half1_index += 1

    # if we still have cards in half2
    # and the "top" card in half2 is the same
    # as the top card in shuffled_deck
    elif (half2_index < len(half2)) and \
            half2[half2_index] == shuffled_deck[shuffled_deck_index]:
        half2_index += 1

    # if the top card in shuffled_deck doesn't match the top
    # card in half1 or half2, this isn't a single riffle.
    else:
        return False

    # the current card in shuffled_deck has now been "accounted for"
    # so move on to the next one
    shuffled_deck_index += 1
    return is_single_riffle(
        half1, half2, shuffled_deck, shuffled_deck_index, half1_index, half2_index
    )

So now we're down to O(n) time, but we're still taking O(n) space in the call
stack because of our recursion. We can rewrite this as an iterative function to
get that memory cost down to O(1).

What's happening in each iteration of our recursive function? Sometimes we're
taking a card off of half1 and sometimes we're taking a card off of half2, but
we're always taking a card off of shuffled_deck.

So what if instead of taking cards off of shuffled_deck 1-by-1, we iterated over
them?

Solution
We walk through shuffled_deck, seeing if each card so far could have come from a
riffle of the other two halves.

To check this, we:

Keep pointers to the current index in half1, half2, and shuffled_deck.

Walk through shuffled_deck from beginning to end.

If the current card in shuffled_deck is the same as the top card from half1,
increment half1_index and keep going. This can be thought of as "throwing out"
the top cards of half1 and shuffled_deck, reducing the problem to the remaining
cards in the stacks.

Same as above with half2.
If the current card isn't the same as the card at the top of half1 or half2, we
know we don't have a single riffle. If we make it all the way to the end of
shuffled_deck and each card checks out, we know we do have a single riffle.

  def is_single_riffle(half1, half2, shuffled_deck):
    half1_index = 0
    half2_index = 0
    half1_max_index = len(half1) - 1
    half2_max_index = len(half2) - 1

    for card in shuffled_deck:

        # if we still have cards in half1
        # and the "top" card in half1 is the same
        # as the top card in shuffled_deck
        if half1_index <= half1_max_index and \
                card == half1[half1_index]:
            half1_index += 1

        # if we still have cards in half2
        # and the "top" card in half2 is the same
        # as the top card in shuffled_deck
        elif half2_index <= half2_max_index and \
                card == half2[half2_index]:
            half2_index += 1

        # if the top card in shuffled_deck doesn't match the top
        # card in half1 or half2, this isn't a single riffle.
        else:
            return False

    # all cards in shuffled_deck have been "accounted for"
    # so this is a single riffle!
    return True

Complexity
O(n) time and O(1) additional space.

Becky if you're reading this I didn't really mean what I said in the problem
statement. It's just that things have been hard lately and anyway if you'll just
give me another chance I promise it won't be like last time. I'm a wreck without
you. Like a collapsed souffle. Please Becky.

Bonus
This assumes shuffled_deck contains all 52 cards. What if we can't trust this
(e.g. some cards are being secretly removed by the shuffle)? This assumes each
number in shuffled_deck is unique. How can we adapt this to rifling lists of
random integers with potential repeats? Our solution returns True if you just
cut the deck take one half and put it on top of the other. While that
technically meets the definition of a riffle, what if you wanted to ensure that
some mixing of the two halves occurred?

What We Learned
If you read the whole breakdown section, you might have noticed that we started
with a recursive function that looked simple but turned out to cost O(n^2) time
and space because each recursive step created its own new "slice" of the input
list. If you missed that part, go back and take a look.

Be careful of the hidden time and space costs of list slicing! Consider tracking
list indices "by hand" instead (as we do in our final solution).

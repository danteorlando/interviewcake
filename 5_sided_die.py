You have a function rand7() that generates a random integer from 1 to 7. Use it
to write a function rand5() that generates a random integer from 1 to 5.

rand7() returns each integer with equal probability. rand5() must also return
each integer with equal probability.

Gotchas
Your first thought might be to simply take the result of rand7() and take a
modulus:

  def rand5():
    return rand7() % 5 + 1

However, this won't give an equal probability for each possible result. We can
write out each possible result from rand7() (each of which is equally probable,
per the problem statement) and see that some results for rand5() are more
likely because they are caused by more results from rand7():

rand7()	rand5()
1	2
2	3
3	4
4	5
5	1
6	2
7	3

So we see that there are two ways to get 2 and 3, but only one way to get 1, 4,
or 5. This makes 2 and 3 twice as likely as the others.

The answer takes worst-case infinite time. However, we can get away with
worst-case O(1) space. Does your answer have a non-constant space cost? If
you're using recursion (and your language doesn't have tail-call optimization),
you're potentially incurring a worst-case infinite space cost in the call
stack. But replacing your recursion with a loop avoids this.

Breakdown
rand5() must return each integer with equal probability, but we don't need to
make any guarantees about its runtime...

In fact, the solution has a small possibility of never returning...

Solution
We simply "re-roll" whenever we get a number greater than 5.

  def rand5():
    result = 7  # arbitrarily large
    while result > 5:
        result = rand7()
    return result

So each integer 1,2,3,4, or 5 has a probability \frac{1}{7}
​7
​
​1
​​  of appearing at each roll.

Complexity
Worst-case O(infinity) time (we might keep re-rolling forever) and O(1) space.

Note that if we weren't worried about the potential space cost (nor the
potential stack overflow) of recursion, we could use an arguably-more-readable
recursive approach with O(infinity) space cost:

  def rand5():
    roll = rand7()
    return roll if roll <= 5 else rand5()

Bonus
This kind of math is generally outside the scope of a coding interview, but: if
you know a bit of number theory you can prove that there exists no solution
which is guaranteed to terminate. Hint: it follows from the fundamental theorem
of arithmetic.

What We Learned
Making sure each possible result has the same probability is a big part of what
makes this one tricky.

If you're ever struggling with the math to figure something like that out,
don't be afraid to just count. As in, write out all the possible results from
rand7(), and label each one with its final outcome for rand5(). Then count up
how many ways there are to make each final outcome. If the counts aren't the
same, the function isn't uniformly random.

We'll review this one again later.
